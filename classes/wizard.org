Become a powerful channel of the magical elements. Use spells primarily, cast using the character's *Intelligence* stat.

To begin as a wizard, choose an element to subclass into: [[[id:7141f6ab-b3bc-4eeb-9e7e-071452bfc673][Fire]] ðŸ”¥, [[id:4ebd35da-05f7-456f-88b8-c8865a270b8f][Storm]] ðŸŒ©, [[id:8153acaf-ac20-4b00-8ac0-fa423c4ff5ce][Radiant]] âœ¨]. Each element comes with some special abilities as you get stronger, and a few distinct advantages right off the bat. All wizards can learn generic spells in the spell index, wizard specific spells, and elemental spells matching their selected element. Be sure you apply your level 1 bonuses from your subclass and pick 1 trait from your subclass to apply to your character. Make sure to review the [[id:7521a020-4fd2-4b75-9e24-5aa4c2fb69e3][Spell Index]] for a full list of applicable spells Wizards can learn.

- _Initial Health_: Roll a 1d6 and add it to your base HP. This is your Hit Die (HD). You will add the amount your roll to your base health every time your level up.
- Spells are cast using INT + PROF (Intelligence modifier + Proficiency modifier)
