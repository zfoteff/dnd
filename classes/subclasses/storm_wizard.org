While storm wizards lack the sheer damage output capabilities of other wizards, Storm Wizards operate using ice and lightning damage. This gives them the flexibility to counter different immunities that a target may posses.

* Elemental Traits
_*Ice Immunity*_: Become immune to ice damage for the rest of the game. You will take half damage if the ice damage is paired with another type of damage.

_*Ice Immunity*_: Become immune to lightning damage for the rest of the game. You will take half damage if the lightning damage is paired with another type of damage.

_*Underwater Breathing*_: You can breathe underwater. Grant one ally of your choice the ability to breath underwater while you are submerged in water. This ends when you exit the water.
* Level 1 Spells
_*Rainstorm*_: It begins raining in a half-mile radius around the caster. This rainstorm may take up to five minutes to begin, depending on the caster's environment. Does not work in Hell.

_*Freeze*_: Roll to hit. On hit, freeze a living creature. While frozen, they cannot move, but can still cast spells and attack enemies within 5 feet. They must roll a constitution save to become unfrozen.

_*Icicle Hand*_: Transform your dominant hand into an icicle. You may stab people without fear of it breaking. The icicle deals 1d10 freeze / piercing damage. This lasts for three turns, and if you successfully stab the same enemy all three turns, they take an extra 2d6 freeze damage.
* Level 2 Spells
_*Lightning Bolt*_: Roll to hit. On hit, summon a lightning bolt from the heavens to strike a target you can see. They take 3d8 lightning damage, and are stunned for one turn if they fail a constitution check.

_*Electric Rain*_: If it's raining, charge raindrops with electricity. Everyone in the rainstorm (allies included) takes 1d8 lightning damage per turn for 8 turns. /This spell cannot be canceled once cast/.

_*Flood*_: Create a wave of water to sweep through the area you designate. The wave begins in the first area out of your eyesight, and gains a foot in size for every 25 feet it travels. At a certain distance away you may be unable to control the size and/or damage of the spell, so use it wisely. /The flood deals half damage to the allies/.
* Level 3 Spells
_*Summon Store Elemental*_: Use your action to summon a storm elemental to fight for you for 6 turns. It has 50 health, deals 2d8 damage on hit, and it has 15 AC. If it lands the killing blow to a target, it stays around for an additional three turns. The storm elemental can only be summoned if there is some sort of water nearby and the party is in combat.

_*Tornado*_: Create a tornado within a 20-foot radius that you are able to control for three turns. It deals 3d8 force damage per turn, but enemies can still avoid damage on a constitution saving throw. /If it is raining during the creation of the tornado, it deals 4d8 force damage instead/. You must concentrate to control the tornado so you cannot move from your position, and if your concentration is broken, it will vanish after the current turn.

* Level 4 Spells
_*Entomb*_: Seal a creature within ice for the next month. This only takes effect if they fail a constitution saving throw (DC 18). During this time, they drop to one health, but do not die and are conscious of the events around them. Entomb instantly kills fire-based creatures. /Huge creatures cannot be entombed/.

_*Hurricane*_: Create a hurricane in any place that /you have been before/. The hurricane lasts for ten turns and deals d10 ice / force damage per turn to all people who fail a constitution saving throw. Its radius is 500 feet. If a creature is damaged by the hurricane twice in a row, they also take the preceding turn's damage.
