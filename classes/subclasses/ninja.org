Use the shadows to your advantage, and gain more maneuverability when avoiding the gaze of the enemy.

* Level 1
Gain 20 shurikens. Shurikens deal 1d6 damage and you can throw two at the same target with one action. Easy to lose, and not readily acquired, be careful!

Gain +2 to stealth
* Level 2
When attacking an enemy from behind, deal an extra 1d6 damage.

When entering combat at night, gain an extra 15 move speed and deal an extra 1d6 damage on every attack

You may now enter combat in a crowded area without anyone else noticing. This "secret combat" lasts for 3 turns, and in the result of a kill on turn one, you still have two to escape. Other players may not enter this combat without other NPCs noticing.
* Level 5
Attacks when falling, running, jumping, somersaulting, or any other sort of athletic move have an additional +2 to hit

Gain +2 to acrobatics
* Level 10
Your maximum shuriken capacity increases to 35. You gain all shurikens back.

Nighttime and damage from behind bonuses increase to 2d6
* Level 15
Deal 150% damage to lawful enemies
* Level 19
Gain Shadow Step: Become completely invisible to everything except Truesight for 3 turns once per combat encounter. During Shadow Step you gain an extra action. You dodge all attacks except those that critically strike during the duration of Shadow Step.
