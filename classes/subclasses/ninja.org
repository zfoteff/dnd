Use the shadows to your advantage, and gain more maneuverability when avoiding the gaze of the enemy.

* Level 1
- Gain 20 iron shurikens. Shurikens deal 1d6 damage and you can throw two at the same target with one action. Easy to lose, and not readily acquired, be careful!
- Gain +2 to stealth
* Level 2
- When attacking an enemy from behind, deal an extra 1d6 damage.
- When entering combat at night, gain an extra 15 move speed and deal an extra 1d6 damage on every attack
- You may now enter combat in a crowded area without anyone else noticing. This "secret combat" lasts for 3 turns, and in the result of a kill on turn one, you still have two to escape. Other players may not enter this combat without other NPCs noticing.
* Level 5
- Attacks when falling, running, jumping, somersaulting, or any other sort of athletic move have an additional +2 to hit
- Gain +2 to acrobatics
* Level 10
- Your maximum shuriken capacity increases to 35. You gain all shurikens back.
- Nighttime and damage from behind bonuses increase to 2d6
* Level 15
- Deal 150% damage to lawful enemies
* Level 19
- Gain _*Shadow Step*_: Become completely invisible to everything except Truesight for 3 turns once per combat encounter. During Shadow Step you gain an extra action. You dodge all attacks except those that critically strike during the duration of Shadow Step.
