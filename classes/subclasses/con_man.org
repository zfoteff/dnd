- _*Striking Looks*_: You are a stunning individual, and your social skills are unmatched. You gain a +2 bonus to all deception and persuasion rolls. You also gain +2 bonus to performance if you are in front of a crowd.
* Level 2
- _*Silver Tongue*_: You're conversational skills are unmatched and you can easily deceive others. You can select a target in combat and make a Deception check contested by the target's Insight.

If the check fails, the target cannot be deceived this way for one hour.
