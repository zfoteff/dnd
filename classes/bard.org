Support the rest of the party using your talents, or your "talents". Uses unique class abilities and spells

To begin playing a Bard, first choose a subclass: [[[id:6a8efa65-451d-4eac-a069-84661a0c69ab][Actor]], [[id:067059f6-be3d-4994-86ca-d7d33a291a79][Muse]], [[id:05331b42-b242-4866-a6e6-df9cdad306e7][Craftsman]]]. These subclasses give you special traits that increase in power as you get stronger, and a few distinct advantages right out the gate. Your character also gains 1 talisman (consult with DM to learn what you get). Be sure you apply your level 1 bonuses from your subclass.

- _Spell attack bonus_: PROF + INT
- _Initial Health_: Roll 1d6 and add it to your base HP. This is your Hit Die (HD). You will add the amount you roll to your base health every time you level up.
