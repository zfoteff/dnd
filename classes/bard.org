Support the rest of the party using your talents, or your "talents". Uses unique class abilities and spells

To begin playing a Bard, first choose a subclass: [[[id:6a8efa65-451d-4eac-a069-84661a0c69ab][Actor]], [[id:067059f6-be3d-4994-86ca-d7d33a291a79][Muse]], [[id:05331b42-b242-4866-a6e6-df9cdad306e7][Craftsman]]]. These subclasses give you special traits that increase in power as you get stronger, and a few distinct advantages right out the gate. Your character also gains 1 talisman (consult with DM to learn what you get). Be sure you apply your level 1 bonuses from your subclass.
