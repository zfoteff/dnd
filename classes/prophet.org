Chosen vessel of a particular God. Prophets do not know which God they channel at the beginning of the game. The prophet has a primary mission of discovering which God they are aligned to by learning about the religious system of the world. Be sure you apply your level 1 bonuses from your Prophet skills and pick 1 trait to apply to your character. Make sure to review the [[id:7521a020-4fd2-4b75-9e24-5aa4c2fb69e3][Spell Index]] for a full list of applicable spells Prophets can learn.

- _Initial Health_: Roll a 1d6 and add it to your base HP. This is your Hit Die (HD). You will add the amount your roll to your base health every time your level up.

* Prophet Traits
- _/Blessed Attacks/_: Your attacks have a 1 in 12 chance to be Blessed by your god, and will have bonus effects depending on your assigned god. Note: /This does not apply if you haven't determined which god you serve./
- _/Devout/_: You may no longer enter religious sites of deities other than your god. However, when you first visit a holy site of your god, you grant the entire party a permanent bonus. /Each god has three holy sites- some are well known, some are secret, so keep looking/! As before, you must have determined which god you serve before this trait can apply to your character.
