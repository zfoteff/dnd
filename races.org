:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bf3ffb0d-c3fe-412a-a40a-4c5933d6320e
:END:
Graceful, beautiful, and intensely magical beings attuned to nature and the harmony of WORLD. Elves love nature, magic, art, and all good things in the world. Elves can live to be more than 700 years old, giving them a very broad and measured perspective on troubling events.

Elves can speak Elvish:
** Racial traits
- Perception proficiency
- Weakness to cold
- Can't be lulled to sleep by magic
* Orc
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3a2aa3c6-e063-47fb-ba4a-c385b9fe3916
:END:
Hulking, proud beings that fight to protect those they choose to be in their clan. Many venture from their tribe seeking adventure a glory for their mighty deeds. The fury of an Orc is not to be trifled with.

Orcs can speak Orc and read Dwarvish.
** Racial traits

Straight from the fires of Hell, demons blend into the world, causing strife and mischief wherever they see fit. They depend on their skills in deception and their innate magical attunement to compensate for their lack of durability.

* Hobbit
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b6aa2e4f-98c1-4c7a-bc9a-fc65a80e306c
:END:
Nobody quite knows how the hobbit came to be. All that is known is that the race has seemly existed on the fringes of society, outlasting kingdoms and empires by avoiding notice and keeping to themselves. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures, but have little patience for complex plans and grand designs.

** Racial traits
- _Brave_: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened
- _Lucky_: When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die. You must use the new result.
* Dwarf

:ID:       a0a931d4-798c-4ace-ae09-9b3cc0a7bc2e
:END:
Deep in the roots of mountains, dwarven kingdoms have raised great treasures, and waged great wars. These skilled workers have superior skills with their hands and hammers, but aren't usually seen as particularly bright.

Dwarves can speak Dwarvish.
** Racial traits
- Tool proficiency
- Dark vision
* Elemental
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c840edb3-d480-4abd-be8a-6954af0b3b76

:END:
Reptilian inhabitants of a foreign land that have made their first strides towards integrating into greater society. Covered in scaly armor and possessing the ability to breath underwater, this species has had a difficult time operating in extreme cold but gets advantages on their actions in extreme heat.

Reptilians speak Lizard.
** Racial Traits
- Waterbreathing
- Weakness to cold
- Heat advantage
- _Foul Creature_: Other races will view you with disdain
