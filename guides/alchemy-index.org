* Alchemy
** Generic Alchemy
- _*Befriend*_: Roll a charisma check. On 14 or higher, turn any non-intelligent creature you are on neutral terms with into an ally. This effect lasts for twenty minutes, after which the creature will enter a state of confusion with a 50% potential to lash out at the party.
- _*Transform*_: Select an animal. From now on, you can transform into this wild animal. Work with DM about its statistics. You health will stay with you throughout the transformation.
