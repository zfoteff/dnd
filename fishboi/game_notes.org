** Spells
*** Translate Speech
For two minutes, become able to verbally communicate with any intelligent creature of your choosing (DM has discretion on what is considered “intelligent”). Nonverbal creatures will be able to understand you if their intelligence is high enough. Translation is NOT telepathy.
*** Telekinesis
Pick one object that is not larger than you to move with your mind. It must be within thirty feet, and you may move it at six inches per second. You may not move animals or NPCs, nor can you move objects in complicated ways.
*** Recast Recharge (?)
*** Chameleon
Disguise yourself as another type of creature until you long rest or decide to cancel the spell. Does not require concentration. You cannot imitate specific beings, but you may choose to belong to another one of the eight available races.
*** Aura Blast
Deal 1d10 energy damage to a single creature using a ray, orb, or shockwave. Once one creature is damaged, the aura blast dissipates.

** Sorcerer Spells
*** Vitality Drain
Pick an enemy within thirty feet to make a constitution saving throw. On failure, decrease an enemy’s maximum health by the amount of damage they took last turn from one of your allies (you get to pick). Until combat is over, they stick with that maximum health and cannot be healed above it.
*** Reversion
Move all people within a 20-foot radius to the location they were in the previous turn. This location can be more than 20 feet away from the Chaos Sorcerer. You cannot send allies or enemies back to Hell or Heaven with this move.
*** Randomness
On hit, deal 1d10 of a random type of damage to an enemy within 30 feet
*** Confuse
Force an enemy within 50 feet to make a constitution saving throw. On failure, deal 1d8 damage to them for three turns. For those three turns, they are confused, and target a random ally instead of low health/weak/close allies.
*** Retroactive Omen
Learn what type of damage an enemy is vulnerable to. The last three attacks from your allies were now of that damage type. Adjust enemies health accordingly

CANNOT go to hell
** E. Lectricity: Storm elemental
