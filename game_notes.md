## Active Spells
Learned spells:

<u>Aura Blast</u>: Deal 1d10 energy damage to a single creature using a ray, orb, or shockwave. Once one creature is damaged, the aura blast dissipates. 

<u>Telekinesis</u>: Pick one object that is not larger than you to move with your mind. It must be within thirty feet, and you may move it at six inches per second. You may not move animals or NPCs, nor can you move objects in complicated ways. 

<u>Vitality Drain</u>: Pick an enemy within thirty feet to make a constitution saving throw. On failure, decrease an enemyâ€™s maximum health by the amount of damage they took last turn from one of your allies (you get to pick). Until combat is over, they stick with that maximum health and cannot be healed above it.
