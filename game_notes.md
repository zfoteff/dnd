## Passive Spells
<u>Translate Speech</u>: For two minutes, become able to verbally communicate with any intelligent creature of your choosing (DM has discretion on what is considered “intelligent”). Nonverbal creatures will be able to understand you if their intelligence is high enough. Translation is NOT telepathy.

<u>Telekinesis</u>: Pick one object that is not larger than you to move with your mind. It must be within thirty feet, and you may move it at six inches per second. You may not move animals or NPCs, nor can you move objects in complicated ways. 

## Active Spells
Learned spells:

<u>Aura Blast</u>: Deal 1d10 energy damage to a single creature using a ray, orb, or shockwave. Once one creature is damaged, the aura blast dissipates. 

<u>Vitality Drain</u>: Pick an enemy within thirty feet to make a constitution saving throw. On failure, decrease an enemy’s maximum health by the amount of damage they took last turn from one of your allies (you get to pick). Until combat is over, they stick with that maximum health and cannot be healed above it.

<u>Reversion</u>: Move all people within a 20-foot radius to the location they were in the previous turn. This location can be more than 20 feet away from the Chaos Sorcerer. You cannot send allies or enemies back to Hell or Heaven with this move.

Woke up hungover in a prison cell in the *wastes*. We were captured by the lizard coalition. We were thrown in the mines before we escaped into the desert

In the desert with Jimson Jamson. Aaron insulted him and we fought him until we blinded him and he ran away. We decided to go to a town with some Small nomadic tents and a few permanent settlements. We are headed towards atlantis in a horse carriage
